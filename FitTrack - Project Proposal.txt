# FitTrack - Project Proposal

## Description
FitTrack is a sleek and easy-to-use fitness tracking web application designed to help users monitor their workouts, set fitness goals, and visualize progress. The app will focus on simplicity, an eye-catching UI, and an intuitive user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user data)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend)

## Focus
This will be a **full-stack** application with equal emphasis on both the frontend UI and backend functionality.

## Type
FitTrack will be a **web application**, optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Goal
The primary goal of FitTrack is to provide users with a visually appealing and straightforward way to:
- Log daily workouts (e.g., exercise type, duration, intensity)
- Set fitness goals and track progress
- View workout history with graphical insights
- Stay motivated through streaks and achievements

## Target Users
FitTrack is designed for:
- **Beginners** looking to establish a workout routine
- **Casual fitness enthusiasts** who want an easy way to track workouts
- **Busy professionals** who need a simple, no-fuss fitness log

## Data Plan
- **User Data**: User profiles, preferences, and workout logs will be stored in MongoDB.
- **Workout Data**: Users can manually log workouts, and the system will track duration, type, and calories burned.
- **Goal Tracking**: Users can set and update fitness goals, with a dashboard displaying their progress.
- **API Usage**: A third-party fitness API may be used for exercise recommendations.

## Project Approach
### Database Schema (Tentative)
- **Users Collection**: `id, name, email, password (hashed), profile details`
- **Workouts Collection**: `id, user_id, exercise_name, duration, calories, date`
- **Goals Collection**: `id, user_id, goal_type, target, current_progress, status`

### Potential Issues
- **Data Management**: Ensuring real-time updates and secure user authentication.
- **UI Optimization**: Creating a responsive and engaging UI without slowing performance.
- **API Integration**: Managing third-party API calls efficiently.

✔ Workout Logging (Manually add workouts)  
✔ Goal Tracking (Set and monitor fitness goals)
